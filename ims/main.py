"""
 Inventory Management System (IMS)

 Project Entry File

 This script serves as the main entry point of the IMS backend.
 It simulates how a warehouse management and order system would
 operate, including:
    - Stock adjustment
    - Order creation
    - Payment processing
    - Subscription renewal

 The architecture follows a modular layered design:
    1. Models (data definitions)
    2. Services (business logic)
    3. API (orchestration / simulated endpoints)
    4. Utils (helpers, CSV export/import, etc.)
